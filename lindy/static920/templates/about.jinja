            <div class="small-12 medium-8 large-9 column">
              <p>The 9:20 Special has been a staple of the San Francisco dance scene since 1998. Originally started by internationally renowned Lindy Hop instructors Paul Overton &amp; Sharon Ashe as a practice party for their students, The 9:20 Special quickly evolved into the most popular spot to go dancing in the Bay Area. After running The 9:20 Special for over 6 years, Paul and Sharon decided to move away from the Bay Area.</p>
              <p>In 2004, they handed the reins over to Jeff Ho, a long time 9:20 Special volunteer and dancer, and Manu Smith, an International Lindy Hop instructor and cofounder of Yehoodi.com. In April 2009, the leadership of The 9:20 Special was passed to enthusiastic Lindy Hoppers Kirk and Iris Tarou who continue to run the show today along with an incredible team of staff and volunteers.</p>

          <p><br>The 9:20 Special is located at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DuYgvrB9CvA2" alt="Google Maps link">The Russian Center, 2460 Sutter St., San Francisco, CA</a>.</p>
          <p>Street parking is available within a few blocks walk. In general, you'll find more parking east of Divisadero. Broderick is a smaller street with a large housing project and less available parking. Try parking on Bush, Post, Scott or Pierce.</p>
          <p>While the neighborhood is fairly safe, it’s still a big city and walking anywhere at night by yourself may not be the wisest decision. If you ever feel uncertain about returning to your car alone, please ask at the front desk and we will be happy to find an escort to walk you to your car.</p>
