              <p>Classes are normally a four-week series, beginning on the first Thursday of the month. Classes are progressive, meaning that every week we build upon the moves taught in the previous class. If you miss the first class of the series, you will be unenrolled and given an account credit to be used toward a future series. New drop-ins are allowed the first week only. All classes include admission to the dance.</p>
              <p>Class series are $55 each if purchased online by midnight of the Tuesday before the first class. If you sign up at the door, our class series are $60 each. *Prices are adjusted for 3-week and 5-week months.</p>
              <p>In order to receive credit for the series, you must attend at least three of the four weeks of class.
              <p>If you would like to take a higher-level class, but don't have the prerequisites, youâ€™ll need to do a level check. We do these the first Thursday of every month at 7PM. You'll social dance with one of our instructors to determine which level is the best fit. Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@920special.com">info@920special.com</a> with any questions.</p>
