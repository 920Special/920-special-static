# Quickstart

If you know how to use npm and python virtual environments then this section is for you! If you don't then you'll need to talk to one of the devs that does as documenting the instalation of python, node, virtualenv, and other build tools is out of the scope of this doc.

    1) create a virtual environment
    2) ensure node.js is installed
    3) `make bootstrap`

# Run it

    ./manage.py runserver
