                    <p>If you are new to swing dancing and Lindy Hop, this monthly series is for you. No partner is necessary as we rotate partners frequently in class.</p>
                    <p>Each series starts on the first Thursday of the month and is progressive, meaning that every week we build upon the moves taught in the previous class. New drop-ins are allowed the first week only. If you've missed the first class, you can take our 30-minute Taster class at 9:00PM then join the series the following month.
                    There are three months of curriculum, which can be taken in any order. You must take all three to move on to Lindy 2.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Lindy 1A: 6&ndash;Count</li>
                    <li>Lindy 1B: 8&ndashCount</li>
                    <li>Lindy 1C: Charleston</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We offer two different Lindy 1 classes every Thursday night, at 7:20PM and at 8:20PM. Students who sign up for the class at 7:20PM can spend half an hour immediately after their class practicing with other students during the Open Practice time. Students who sign up for the class at 8:20PM can transition straight into the social dance in the main ballroom after their class. Even though two Lindy 1 classes are offered each month, itâ€™s recommended you only take one at a time. All classes include admission to the social dance.</p>
